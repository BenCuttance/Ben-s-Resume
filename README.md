# Ben-s-Resume

# Description 

This webpage has been developed as a showcase of my developing skills for potential employers. This webpage has multiple links and placeholder images that will be used to link future projects so that employers are able to see the skillsets i've developed throughout the course. 

This webpage has an interactive header with links that take users to different areas of the page quickly, with a hover effect. The main body of the webpage has one big placeholder image and four smaller images which will be replaced with future projects images and links. Currently the images just link back to webpage itself. These images also have a hover effect which changes the contrast which allows users to see which image they've selected and that its clickable. These images have been formatted in a flexbox to show my ability to use advanced CSS skills.

The footer of the page contains more links that allow users to get into contact with me. Currently these link back to the webpage as these social networks have not been created yet for users to visit. These links also have a different hover effect in an attempt to show employers my versatility using CSS. 

Using media queries this webpage has been coded to fit onto the screen of any mobile phone, whilst still maintaining its usage and unique design.
